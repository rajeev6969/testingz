    <h1>Learning PowerBuilding</h1>
    <p>Powerbuilding is a type of program that incorporates two kinds of training: Powerlifting and Bodybuilding. Powerlifting focuses on the strength of an athlete's three main lifts: the Deadlift, Bench Press, and Squats. Bodybuilding, on the other hand, focuses on building muscle volume to showcase muscle gains through poses required in competition.</p>
